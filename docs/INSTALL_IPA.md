# Install the developer-preview IPA

SunPad 0.1.0 Preview 5 is an unsigned arm64 IPA for iPhone and iPad. It must
be re-signed with your own Apple identity before installation.

Preview 5 maps left shoulder to Z, right shoulder to a medium-pressure
run-and-spray stream, and right trigger to the strong stream. **Report a
Problem…** asks three short questions, exports a bounded diagnostic report, and
opens the matching GitHub issue form. The default-off **Experimental
Performance Mode (Restart Required)** remains a test option and may affect game
timing, audio, physics, or rendering; stable mode remains the default.

1. Download
   [`SunPad-0.1.0-preview.5-unsigned.ipa`](https://github.com/chrissotraidis/sunpad/releases/download/v0.1.0-preview.5/SunPad-0.1.0-preview.5-unsigned.ipa)
   from the [Preview 5 release](https://github.com/chrissotraidis/sunpad/releases/tag/v0.1.0-preview.5).
2. Verify the SHA-256 shown in the release notes and GitHub asset digest.
3. Re-sign the IPA with a sideloading workflow you trust, making sure the
   nested `gGMSE01_recomp.dylib` is signed along with the app.
4. Install and open it. On first launch, choose **Choose ISO or GCM** and select
   your own legally obtained `GMSE01` USA revision 0 ISO/GCM image. To replace
   it later, use **••• → Game Data & Saves → Import or Reimport Game Data**.

If selecting the image through a Files provider does not work, put it directly
in **Files → On My iPhone/iPad → SunPad**, then choose **••• → Game Data & Saves
→ Import from SunPad Folder**. SunPad keeps the dropped file in Documents and
imports a validated private copy, so remove the dropped file yourself only
after the game has launched successfully if you want to reclaim that space.

The IPA contains the open-source SunPad/ModernGekko runtime and its required
GMSE01 ahead-of-time recompiled executable module. It contains no disc image,
extracted game assets, save, settings, certificate, or provisioning profile.
It is not an App Store, TestFlight, or computer-free installation release.

## LiveContainer status

LiveContainer is not currently a supported or verified SunPad launch path. One
user reports that Preview 1 does not work there, but no actionable environment,
signature, or log evidence has been collected. The supported preview workflow
remains re-signing both Mach-O files and installing the IPA normally.

A bounded August 11, 2026 source/package audit found no obvious structural
conflict to patch in SunPad. At upstream LiveContainer commit
[`fe4c0ea`](https://github.com/LiveContainer/LiveContainer/blob/fe4c0ea7607322f7a2c7aa3111d7082054b14c8b/ZSign/zsign.mm#L262-L285),
the ZSign path recursively enumerates and signs every regular 64-bit Mach-O in
the guest bundle rather than only files under `Frameworks`. LiveContainer also
[redirects `NSBundle.mainBundle` to the guest app](https://github.com/LiveContainer/LiveContainer/blob/fe4c0ea7607322f7a2c7aa3111d7082054b14c8b/README.md#patching-nsbundlemainbundle).
The audited SunPad IPA contains `SunPad.app/gGMSE01_recomp.dylib` and
`DeviceModuleRelativePath = gGMSE01_recomp.dylib`, so the current evidence does
not support moving the module or changing the loader speculatively. This is a
source-level compatibility finding, not proof that SunPad launches there.

Before reporting a failure, use a current official LiveContainer build, run its
JIT-Less Mode Diagnose when applicable, and use the app-specific **Force
Re-sign** action if diagnosis succeeds. LiveContainer's own
[signing troubleshooting](https://livecontainer.github.io/docs/faq/installing-livecontainer)
recommends those checks for invalid-signature failures.

For a useful LiveContainer investigation, record:

- exact IPA filename and SHA-256;
- LiveContainer version and download source;
- device model and OS version;
- signing and JIT settings;
- result of JIT-Less Mode Diagnose and Force Re-sign, when applicable;
- signature/identity output for both `SunPad.app/SunPad` and
  `SunPad.app/gGMSE01_recomp.dylib`;
- whether a window appears and the first visible error;
- LiveContainer launch output and a privacy-reviewed **••• → Share Diagnostic
  Log…** snapshot; and
- whether the same IPA works after a normal complete re-sign and installation.

Do not attach the game image, extracted game assets, saves, signing material,
or a device container. A LiveContainer launch failure does not by itself show
that the audited IPA or normal installation path is broken.
