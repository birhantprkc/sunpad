## Smallest coherent dependency set selected for Stage 1

Required now:

1. **DolRecomp** — generate portable C (or later LLVM objects) from `main.dol`.
2. **ModernGekko** (+ vendored dolphin/RecompCore branch and required Externals) — host runtime, module packaging, launch.
3. **ModernGekko-Template** — orchestrates extract → recompile → module → run.

Useful but secondary:

- **doldecomp/sms** — symbols/maps/progress for research; not a playable native path by itself.
- **StrikersRecomp** — packaging and game-specific HLE patterns as an analogy.
- **BellPad** — Apple app structure for Stages 2–4.

Not selected as primary runtime:

- Standalone generic Dolphin JIT frontend as the product.
- Incomplete matching decompilation as the sole executable core.

## Build requirements implied by upstream

- C11 / C++23 toolchain (AppleClang verified for template compiler check).
- CMake + Ninja + pkg-config + Git + Python.
- ModernGekko dolphin vendor Externals for SDL, zlib-ng, libspng, VMA, cubeb, SPIRV-Cross, libusb (initialized locally as needed).
- No game data is downloaded by these repositories.

## iOS Simulator build requirements (SunPad)

- Xcode 26.x with the iOS 26.x Simulator SDK.
- The vendored `fmt`, `lz4`, and `zstd` sources. The iOS core build compiles
  the required static libraries in its own ignored build tree;
  they do not consume unexplained prebuilt libraries from `/tmp`.
- The iOS toolchain file lives at `scripts/ios-simulator-toolchain.cmake`.

## Update policy

When any external checkout moves, update this file with the new SHA and the reason for the bump. Prefer official ExpansionPak / doldecomp upstreams over stale forks.

## Repository hygiene note

The `ref/` checkouts and the local disc image are Git-ignored wholesale: each
checkout is a nested Git repository, so committing them would create broken
gitlinks or vendor bloat. A fresh machine reproduces the required runtime tree
and its reviewed SunPad changes with `./scripts/bootstrap-dependencies.sh`,
then validates and prepares its own supported image with
`./scripts/prepare-game.sh /path/to/GMSE01.iso`. The bootstrap covers the
required ModernGekko (including vendored Dolphin and DolRecomp) and ModernGekko-Template
pins; the other entries above are research references and are not required by
that build workflow.
